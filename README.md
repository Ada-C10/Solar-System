# Solar System

## At a Glance

- Build a model of a solar system to practice classes
- Individual, [stage 1](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/pedagogy/blob/master/rule-of-three.md#stage-1) project
- Due before class, Monday Feb 12

## Intro

Let's make a planetary system!

Our customer needs to be able to learn about a solar system. By the end of our Solar System project, our customer will be able to interact with the program and choose which pieces of information they can see at a time, specifically by choosing which planet.

In wave 1, this project will encourage us to work with hard-coded data, which allows our code to be more simple and readable with a small amount of data. In wave 2, this project will shift our code away from the hard-coded data and instead to use classes. Using classes will allow our code to be more extensible. In wave 3, we will use that work from wave 2 to allow a user to interact with the program, view all planets, and create a new planet.



## Learning Goals

- Practice creating custom classes
- Use a hash to initialize an object
- Create an object which contains a collection of other objects
- Practice creating instance methods


# Wave 1
The learning goal for this wave is to work on building a single class.

## Primary Requirements
- Create a `SolarSystem` class with an `@planets` instance variable.
- Create an initialize method which should take a collection of planet names and store them in an `@planets` instance variable.
- Create a method that adds a planet to the list (not using user input).
- Create a method which will return, **not print**, a list of the planets as a String in this style:

```bash
1.  Mercury
2.  Venus
3.  Earth
4.  Mars
5.  Jupiter
6.  Hoth
```
- Write code to test your SolarSystem
- Instead of Strings for planets, modify SolarSystem's `initialize` method to take a list of hashes where each planet is sent as a hash with at least 5 attributes. For example, your code _could_ now look like this:
```ruby
planet_a = { name: "Planet A", attrA: "A", attrB: "B" }
planet_b = { name: "Planet B", attrA: "C", attrB: "D" }
my_solar_system = SolarSystem.new( [ planet_a, planet_b ] )
```

## Optional Enhancements
- Give each planet a `year_length` attribute which is the length of time the planet takes to go around its star.  
- Give each planet a `distance_from_the_sun` attribute
- (This becomes a requirement in Wave 3.) Write a program that asks for user input to query the planets:
  - First, ask the user to select a planet they'd like to learn about.
  - Present the user with a list of planets from which they can choose. Something like:
    - `1. Mercury, 2. Venus, 3. Earth, 4. Secret Earth, 5. Mars, 6. Jupiter, ... 13. Exit`
  - Provide the user with well formatted information about the planet (diameter, mass, number of moons, primary export, etc.)
  - Then ask the user for another planet.

# Wave 2
The learning goal for this wave is to work on building multiple classes, and composing these classes together.

## Primary Requirements
- Create a `Planet` class which will represent a planet.
    - Add an `initialize` method which takes several arguments and uses them to set the class' instance variables.
    - Create a method that **returns** the Planet's attributes in an easy to read fashion.
    - Create reader methods to give a user access to read the instance variables.
- Make your `SolarSystem` class take an array of `Planet`s instead of hashes.
    - When printing the planet list or planet details, it should call the corresponding method in `Planet`.

## Optionals
-  (This becomes a requirement in Wave 3.) Create a method, outside any class, which creates a planet from user input.

# Wave 3
The learning goal for this wave is to build a UI.

## Primary Requirements
- Create an interface where the user can interact with the solar system and be able to select a planet and view information about it.  
- Allow your user to add their own planet.  

## Optional Enhancements
- Ensure that the each planet has a `@distance_from_the_sun` attribute. Using this data, add a method to determine the distance from any other planet (assuming planets are in a straight line from the sun)
- Give your solar system an age (in earth years).
- Define a method that returns the local year of the planet based on it's rotation since the beginning of the solar system
